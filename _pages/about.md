My name is Shubham Shinde. I am a research scholar at NCBS, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. I am interested in history and philosophy, particularly the philosophy that came out of Indian Freedom Struggle and Civil Rights Movement. Some of the philosophers I want to read in near time are James Baldwin, WEB Du Bois, Martin Luther King Jr, Mahatma Gandhi, Rahul Sankrityan, and DD Kosambi.
